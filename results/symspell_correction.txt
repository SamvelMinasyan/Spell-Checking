whole of her sex it was not that he felt any emotion kain to love for irene adler all emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind be was a take tip ﻿the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that ﻿the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position be never spoke of ﻿the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer they were admirable things fro ﻿the observer--excellent for drawing ﻿the veil from menus motives and actions but for ﻿the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results brit in a sensitive instruments or a crack in one of his own high-powre

study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by ﻿the official police from time to time a heard some vague account of his doings of his summons to odessa in tech case of he ripoff murder of his clearing up of he singular tragedy of ﻿the atkinson brothers at trincomalee and finally of tech mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for ﻿the refining family of holland beyond these signs of his activity however which a merely shared with all ﻿the readers of ﻿the daily press a knew little of my former friend and companion one night--it was on ﻿the twentieth of march 1888--I as returning from a journey to a patient for a had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through maker street is a passed ﻿the well-remembeerd door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with ﻿the dark incidents of ﻿the study in scarlet a was seized with a keen desire of see holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers is rooms were brilliantly lite and even as a looked up a saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against ﻿the blind be was pacing ﻿the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him to me who knew his very mood and habits his attitude and manner old their on story be was at work again of had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon ﻿the scent of some new problem a rang ﻿the bell and was shown up to ﻿the chamber which had formerly been in part my own is manner was not effusive it seldom was but he was glad a think of see me with hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasoline in he corner when he stood before ﻿the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion wedlock suits you he remarked of think watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since a saw you "Seven!" a answered "Indeed, a should have thought a little more just a trifle more a fancy watson and in practice again a observed you did ont tell me that you intended to go into harness "Then, how do you konw?" of see it a deduce it now do a know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girls by dear Holmes," said of this is too much you would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago it is true that a had a country wall no thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but a a have changed my clothes a can't imagine how you deduce it is to mary panel she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but their again a fail to see how you work it out be chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together it is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on ﻿the inside of your left shoes just here ﻿the firelight strikes it ﻿the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round ﻿the edges of ﻿the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of ﻿the london slave is to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black make of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a blue no ﻿the right side of his topcoat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope a must be dull indeed if a do not pronounce him to be an active member of ﻿the medical professional a could not help laughing at ﻿the ease with which he explained his process of deduction when a her you give your reasons a remarked ﻿the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that a could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning a am baffled until you explain your process and yet a believe that my eyes are as good as yours quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair you see but you do not observed he distinction is clear for example you have frequently seen ﻿the step which lead up from ﻿the hall to this room "Frequently." now often "Well, some hundreds of tiems." "Tehn how many are there now many a don't know quite so you have not observed and yet you have seen that is juts my point now a know that there are seventeen steps because a have both seen and observed by ﻿the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this be threw over a sheet of thick pin-ktinted notepaper which had been lying open upon tech table it came by ﻿the lats psot," said he read it aloud he note was undated and without either signature or address there will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o'clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of ﻿the very deepest moment your recent services of one of ﻿the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated this account of you we have from all quarters received be in you chamber then at that hours and of not take to amiss if your visitor water a mask this is indeed a mystery a remarked that do you imagine that it means of have no data yet it is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts but ﻿the note itself that do you deduce from it a carefully examined ﻿the writing and he paper upon which it was written ﻿the man who wrote it was presumably well to do a remarked endeavouring to imitate my companions processes such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet it is peculiarly strong and stiff "Peculiar--that is ﻿the very wodr," said holmes it is not an english paper at all plod it up to ﻿the light a did so and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small to woven into ﻿the texture of tech paper that do you make of that asked holmes ﻿the name of ﻿the maker no doubt or his monogram rather not at all he 'G' with ﻿the small it stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is ﻿the german fro 'Company.' it is a customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course stands for 'aPpier.' now for ﻿the 'Eg.' get us glance at our continental Gazetteer." be took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves "Eglow, Elgonitz--here we are ugrian it is in a German-speaking country--in bohemian not far from carlsbad remarkable as being ﻿the scene of he death of wallenstein and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' a has my boy what do you make of that is eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette ﻿the paper was made in Bhoemia," a said "Precisely. and ﻿the man who wrote ﻿the note is a germany to you note ﻿the peculiar construction of ﻿the sentence--'This account of you we have from all quarters received a frenchman or russian could not have written that it is ﻿the german who is so courteous to his verbs it only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face and here he comes if a am not mistaken to resolve all our odubts." is he spoke there was ﻿the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against ﻿the curb followed by a sharp pull at ﻿the bell holmes whistled of pair by ﻿the sound said he "Yes," he continued glancing out of he windows of nice little brougham and a pair of beauties a hundred and fifty guineas apiece here's money in this case watson if there is nothing else of think that a had better go Holmes." not a bit oDctor. stay where you are a a lost without my roswell and this promises to be interesting it would be a pity to miss it but your client--" never mind him a may want your help and so may he here he comes it down in that armchair doctor and give us your best attention a slow and heavy step which had been heard upon ﻿the stairs and in ﻿the passage paused immediately

while tech deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with falme-coloured silk and secured at ﻿the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed to ﻿the tops with rich brown fur completed ﻿the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance be carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across ﻿the upper part of is face extending down past ﻿the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered from ﻿the lower part of ﻿the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lips and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to ﻿the length of

bohemian nobleman a understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom a may trust with a matter of ﻿the most extreme importance of not a should much prefer of

circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow of be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of ﻿the reigning families of europe to speak plainly ﻿the matter implicates tech great use of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia." of was also aware of that murmured holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at ﻿the languid lounging figure of ﻿the man who had been no doubt depicted to him a ﻿the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently to his gigantic client of your majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked of should be better able to advise you he an sprang from his
