I have seldom heard him mention her under any toher name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion kain to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably blaanced mind. He wa,s I take ti, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine thta the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable tihngs fro the observer--excellent for drwaing the veil from men's motives adn actions. But for the trained reasnoer to admit such intrusions into his own delicate nad finely adjusetd temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one fo his own high-powre lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. Adn yet tehre aws but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and quesitonable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happinses, and the home-centred interests which ries up around the man who first finsd himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of soicety with his whole Bohemian suol, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried amnog his old book,s adn alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowisness of the drug, and teh fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, nad occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeelss by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in teh case of hte Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of hte singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of teh mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the regining family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, howeevr, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily perss, I knew little of my former friend and companino. One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I aws returning from a journey to a pateint (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembeerd door, which must always be sasociated ni my midn with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized wiht a keen desire ot see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looekd up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass tiwce ni a adrk silhoeutte against the blind. He was pacing the romo swiftly, eagrely, with his head usnk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his veery mood and habit, his attitude and manner otld their onw story. He was at work again. eH had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell adn was shown up to the chamebr hwich had formrely been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom wa;s but he was glad, I think, ot see me. With hardly a word sopken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchai,r threw across his case of cigar,s and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene ni hte corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. "Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, htat you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you." "Seven!" I answered. "Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And ni practice again, I observe. You did ont tell me that you intended to go into harness." "Then, how do you konw?" "I see it, I deduce i.t How do I know that you hvae been getting yuorself very wet lately, and thta you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?" M"y dear Holmes," said I, "this si too much. You would certainly have been burend, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a conutry wakl no Thursday adn came hoem in a dreadful mess, but sa I hvae changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given ehr notice, but theer, again, I afil to see how you work it out." He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. "It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me htat on the inside fo your left shoe, just hwere the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, ym double deduction taht yuo had been out in vile weather, and that you had a aprticularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks itno my rooms smelling of iodoform, wiht a black makr of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bluge no the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secerted his stethoscope, I must be dlul, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession." I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. "When I haer yuo igve your reasons," I remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridciulously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eeys are as good as yours." "Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down nito an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the stesp which lead up from the hall to this room." "Frequently." "How often"? "Well, some hundreds of tiems." "Tehn how many are there?" "oHw many? I don't know." "Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is juts my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may eb interseted in this." He threw over a sheet of thick, pin-ktinted ntoepaper which had been lying open upon teh table. "It came yb the lats psot," siad he. "Read it aloud." The note was undated, and without either signature or address. "There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services ot one of the royal houses fo Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be ni yoru chamber then at that hour, and od not take ti amiss if your visitor waer a mask." "This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that it means?" "I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibyl one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?" I carefully examined the writing, adn hte paper upno which it was written. "The man who wrote it was rpesumably well to do," I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff." "Peculiar--that is the very wodr," said Holmes. "It is not an English paper at all. Hlod it up to the light." I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of teh paper. "What do you make of that?" asked Holmes. "The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monorgam, rather." "Not at all. The 'G' with the small ''t stands for 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German fro 'Company.' It is a customray contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for 'aPpier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our oCntinental Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. "Eglow, Elgonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being the scene of hte death of Wallenstein, and for its unmerous glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and eh sent up a rgeat blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. "The paper was made in Bhoemia," I said. "Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of you we have from lal quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the Greman who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian apper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our odubts." As eh spoke tehre was the sharp sound of horess' hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. "A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing out of hte window. "A niec little brougham and a pair fo beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apeice. There's omney in this cas,e Watson, if htere is nothing else." "I think that I had better go, Holmes." "Not a bit, oDctor. Stay where you are. I ma lost without my Boswell. And tihs promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it." "But your client--" "Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armhcair, Doctor, and give us your best attention." A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediatley outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative atp. "Come in!" sadi Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less htan six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich wtih a richness whihc would, ni England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while teh deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined iwth falme-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway pu his calves, adn which were trimmed ta the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat ni his hand, while he wore acorss the upper part of ihs face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still rasied to it as he etnered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, srtaight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. "You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly makred German accent. "I told you that I would call." eH looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. "Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. hWom have I the honour to address?" "Yuo may address me as hte Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer ot communicate wiht you alone." I rose to go, but Holmes caguht em by the wrist nad pushed me back inot my chair. "tI is bot,h or none," sadi he. "You mya sya before this gentleman anything which you may say to me." The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must beign," said he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy fro two years; at the edn of that time hte matter will be of no importance. At present it is nto too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history." "I promise," asid Holmes. "Adn I." "You will xecuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The august person who employs me wishes his agent to eb unknown to you, nad I mya confess at once taht the title by whcih I have just called myself is not exactly my own." "I was aware of i,t" said Holmes dryly. "The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to qeunch what migth grow ot be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates teh great Huose of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia." "I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and lcosing his eye.s Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him sa the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened hsi eeys and looked impatiently ta hsi gigantic client. "If your Majesty would codnescend to state your case," he remarked, I" should be better able to advise you." The amn sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the maks from his face and hurled it upon teh ground. "You are right," he cired; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to cocneal it?" "hWy, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, adn hereditary King of Bohemia." "But you can understand," sadi our strange visitor, sitting down ocne more and passing his hnad over his high white forehead, "you can understnad that I am not accustomed to oding such business in my own person. Yet the mtater was so delicate that I could ont confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting oyu." "Then, pray consult," said Holme,s shutting his eyes once more. "The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to aWrsaw, I made the acquaitnance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you." "Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had daopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concernnig men and things, so thta it was difficult to name a subject or a person no which he could not at once furnihs information. nI this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Herbew rabbi and that of a tsaff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. "Let me see!" said Holmse. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the yera 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young perosn, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back." "Precisely so. But how--" "Was there a secret marriage?" "None." "No legal papers or certificates?" "None." "Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters ofr blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?" "There is the writing." "oPoh, pooh! Forgery." "My prviate note-paper." "Stolen." "My own seal." "Imitated." M"y photograph." "Bought." "We were both in the photograph." "Oh, dear! That is vrey bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion." "I was mad--insane." "You have compromised yourself seriously." "I was onyl Crown Prince then. I was young. I am ubt thirty nwo." "tI must be recovered." "We haev tried and failed." Y"our Majesty must pay. It must be bought." "hSe will not sell." "Stolen, then." "Five attempts have bene made. Twice burglars in ym pay ransacked her hous.e Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result." "No sign of i?t" "Absolutely none." Holmse laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he. "But a evry serious one to me," retruned the King reproachfully. "Very, indeed. And what deos she propose ot do with the photogrpah?" "To ruin me." "But how?" "I am abotu to be married." "So I have heard." "To Coltilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the tsrict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A sahdow fo a doubt as ot my conduct would bring the matter to an end." "And Irene Adler?" "Threatens to send thme the photograph. And she will od it. I know that seh will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, nad hte mind fo the most resolute of men. Rather thna I should maryr another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go--none". "You are suer thta she has not sent it yet?" I" am sure." "nAd why?" "Because she has said that she owuld send it on the day when the betrothla was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday." "Oh, then we have three adys yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?" "Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm." "Then I shall drop you a line to let you k
