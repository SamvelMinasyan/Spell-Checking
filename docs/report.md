# Spell Checker Evaluation Report

## Introduction
This report evaluates spell checkers (TextBlob, SymSpell) on a synthetic dataset with various spelling errors. Each spell checker’s performance is assessed based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and edit distance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: A dataset with synthetic spelling errors was created.
2. **Tools Evaluated**:
   - **TextBlob**: Simple dictionary-based correction.
   - **SymSpell**: Fast, dictionary-based correction with good performance for common errors.

3. **Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of words correctly corrected.
   - **Precision, Recall, F1 Score**: Word-by-word comparison.
   - **Edit Distance**: Provides similarity measurement.

## Results

| Spell Checker | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | Edit Distance |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| TextBlob      | 0.94     | 0.95      | 0.94   | 0.94     | 0.33          |
| SymSpell      | 0.67     | 0.59      | 0.67   | 0.62     | 0.20          |

## Analysis
1. **TextBlob**:
   - Performs quickly and efficiently but lacks contextual accuracy.
   - Best suited for minor, non-contextual spelling errors.

2. **SymSpell**:
   - Very fast, handling large text volumes well. 
   - Does not understand context but performs well for straightforward corrections.

## Conclusion
while SymSpell was the fastest, TextBlob gave better results. A combined approach using SymSpell for preliminary 
corrections, followed by some LLM(like GPT-3) for context-sensitive refinement, could balance accuracy and efficiency.

## Future Work
1. **Hybrid Spell Checker**: Combining SymSpell’s speed with some LLM's contextual accuracy.
2. **Adaptive Dictionary Expansion**: Updating dictionaries to improve coverage.
3. **Fine-Tuning Models**: Fine-tuning a smaller model on error data could improve efficiency and accuracy.
